🌮 Challenge: Food Ordering App
As a developer, you are tasked with creating a food ordering application in React. This is the first iteration of an application that is going to be much larger in the future so it is important to create a solid foundation from which the code base can grow.
√ <!--Name food ordering App -->
√ <!-- "MarkEve's Food Orders To Go" -->

The menu UI will be in its own component as will the order UI. App.js controls of all the data in state, renders the other components, and passes data to the menu and the order component.
√ <!--Create component file named MenuItems  -->
√ <!-- Create a component file named Order -->
√ <!-- Use App.js file for all data in state, to render other components and pass data to the menuItems and order components -->

📚 User Stories

As a user, I can see an application that has a list of food items and the price of each item.
Hint: Take some time to think about the data structure that will allow you to effectively store the required information.
√ <!-- Create a list of food items -->
√ <!-- Include the prices of the list of each food item -->
√ <!-- Choose a function/method/data structure that will store the information -->
√ <!-- Create an array to store the List of food and prices -->

As a user, I can click a button to select an item I wish to order.
√ <!-- Create a button for each item named "Order". -->

As a user, I can see the items I have selected to order displayed on the page.
√ <!-- Display each item ordered on the page -->

🏔 Stretch Goals

As a user, I can see the total cost of my current order.
<!-- Create a function named "Total Cost" for the total cost of current order -->

As a user, I can see both the base total cost of my food selections and the total that includes sales tax.
<!-- Create a function named "Base Total" to show cost of food selections. -->
<!-- Include the "Total Cost" to include sales tax -->

As a user, I can see the total that includes sales tax rounded to two decimals.
<!-- In the "Total Cost" function, include "sales tax" rounded to 2 decimals -->

As a user, I can see an image of my food selection on the menu.
<!-- Go to google images and choose images for each food selection -->
