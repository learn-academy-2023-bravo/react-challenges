As a developer, you are tasked with creating an application where three "robots" are listening to the text that a user types. 

As the user types, each robot responds in real time with a different modification to the input.
    pseudocode:
        -use input tag to capture user imput
        -each robot will respond to the user imput at the same time with diffrent responsnses

It is a best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code. 
In this application, App.js will handle the state values, inputs, and event listener method.
    pseudocode:
        -App.js will handle the state values, inputs, and event listener method.
        -create 3 display compoents per chatbot and pass user imput to chat bot
        -use functional props to return chat bots response 

The state value can be passed to the nested components where the individualized manipulation of words can be handled by each robot.
