# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

üüß Challenge: Color Box
As a developer, you are tasked with creating a color box application. The application will allow the user to click a box and see a different color with every click.

üìö User Stories
As a user, I can see a square box on the screen with a black border and a white background
As a user, I can see the default color name "white" inside the box
As a user, every time I click on the box the name of a different color appears
Possible color names: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink
As a user, every time I click the box instead of the color name, I see the background color in the box change to represent the color.
As a user, I can see many boxes on the page all acting independently of one another.
üèî Stretch Goals
As a user, I can start with no boxes on the screen
As a user, I can see a button to add a box
As a user, I can see a button to remove a box
As a user, every time I click the add button, I can add an additional box that acts independently of the other boxes
As a user, every time I click the remove button, I can remove the last box in the series
