ü§ñ Challenge: Listening Robot
As a developer, you are tasked with creating an application where three "robots" are listening to the text that a user types. As the user types, each robot responds in real time with a different modification to the input.

When creating a project it is important to think about organizing your code so that you are not repeating yourself unnecessarily. It is a best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code. In this application, App.js will handle the state values, inputs, and event listener method. Each robot will be in its own display component. The state value can be passed to the nested components where the individualized manipulation of words can be handled by each robot.

Process:

-create 3 components Robot1, Robot2, Robot3
-create {useState}, event listener method, and inputs on App.js
-Import at the top, and component call at the bottom for all three Robots onto App.js
-Identify props on our individual component files, and create functional props to communicate back to the components


üìö User Stories


As a user, I can see a landing page with heading and a text input.


As a user, I see titles of three robots waiting for my text.


As a user, I see my "Good Robot" repeating exactly what I type in real time.
- need to store what the user is typing, using state variable called userInput
- Reference the variable under the good title

Pseudo:
- create a function called handleChange
- input: DOM event from the onChange attribute from the input tag
- output: what the user types

As a user, I see my "Bad Robot" saying "BLABLA....." One character for every character I type in real time.
- check the pattern, every third index the letter repeats
- index + 3
- input:  A l o h a 
- Output: B L A B L
- index:  0 1 2 3 4

- indexes for B: 0, 3
- indexes for L: 1, 4
- indexes for A: 2, 5

Pseudo:
- create a function called handleChange
- input: DOM event from the onChange attribute from the input tag
- output: replacing what the user types with "B" "L" or "A" 
- for loop will provide numbers for us to reference the indexes
- we will reassign the value at the index 
for "B", userInput[i], userInput[i + 3]
for "L", userInput[i + 1], userInput[i + 4]
for "A", userInput[i + 2], userInput[i + 5]
- setter function (setUserInput) will update the userInput withblaWord
-  

As a user, I see a third robot that modifies the input as per the developer's choice in real time.






üèî Stretch Goals
As a user, I see a fourth robot that modifies the input as per the developer's choice in real time.
As a user, I can see pleasant stylings on the application.
