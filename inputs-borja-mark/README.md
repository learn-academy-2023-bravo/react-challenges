# React Inputs and Events

#### Overview

React applications are designed to handle user interactions quickly and efficiently. Button click are one example of user interactions. Buttons can trigger code logic execution that changes what the user sees in the application. Another common way users interact with an application is through text input fields. Inputs allow a user to add unique content to an application. Developers can track each keystroke made my the user and save the information for use in the code logic.

#### Learning Objectives

- can define DOM events
- can define event listeners
- can distinguish between an event handler method and a state method
- can recall the JSX attributes needed to collect user inputs

#### Vocabulary

- DOM events
- event listeners
- onChange
- type attributes
- value attribute
- handler method

#### Additional Resources

- [JavaScript Events](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-events/)
- [W3Schools HTML Input](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp)

#### Process

- `cd` into the `react-challenges` repository
- Create a new branch: `inputs-initials1-initials2` (ex. inputs-aw-sp)
- Create a new React application with no spaces: `yarn create react-app inputs-student1-student2` (ex. yarn create react-app inputs-austin-sarah)
- `cd` into the project
- Open the project in a text editor
- Create a directory in _src_ called _components_
- Code!

#### Useful Commands

- $ yarn start
- control + c (stops the server)
- control + t (opens a new terminal tab)

### üìö User Stories

- As a user, I can see a landing page with heading and a text input.
- As a user, I see titles of three robots waiting for my text.
- As a user, I see my "Good Robot" repeating exactly what I type in real time.
- As a user, I see my "Bad Robot" saying "BLABLA....." One character for every character I type in real time.
- As a user, I see a third robot that modifies the input as per the developer's choice in real time.

### üèî Stretch Goals

- As a user, I see a fourth robot that modifies the input as per the developer's choice in real time.
- As a user, I can see pleasant stylings on the application.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Stretch Goals

- As a developer, I have a well commented application.
- As a developer, I have well written README file with instructions on how to access my repository.
- As a developer, my variables are all named semantically.
- As a developer, I have refactored and efficient code.
- As a developer, I have my application [deployed as a live website](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app).

- Pseudo Code:

1. Create a React input - done
2. Create a state variable - done
3. Create a function (Good Robot) 
4. Create a function (Bad Robot) 
5. Create a function (Kanyebot 5000)
